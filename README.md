# osu! Mappool Showcase Server
This project has made for Mezelyus' Summer Tournament 2021. It can basically load beatmap and replay data inside the program and serve it as overlay in OBS. Therefore, it does not contain background designs, etc. but only renders texts and map/player images.

### Basic Usage

Overlay (and also application) will be served on 9000 port. To access overlay, you can simply edit and use this url: `http://localhost:9000/show/{modpool}/{modpool number}`.

For example: `http://localhost:9000/show/nm/1`
